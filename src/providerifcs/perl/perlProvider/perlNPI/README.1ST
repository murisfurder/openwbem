Please issue 'perl Makefile.PL'.
 If the makemaker module is installed on your system, this command should build the correct Makefile.
Then build the perlNPI module with make and install it (as root!) with make install.


In case of rebuilding, make sure that you delete the files
perlNPI.pm
auto/perlNPI/*

found in the directory

/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/{perl version}/{perl architecture}/

for example
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/i586-linux/


manually !!!
